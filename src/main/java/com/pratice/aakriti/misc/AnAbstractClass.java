 * Abstract class' life's whole purpose is to be extended
 * Abstract class can have no abstract method
 * Any abstract method can not exist in non-abstract class
 * Abstract classes/interface can not be instantiated, can only be instantiated with

 * 
 * Final is the keyword which is used for references
 * Final classes can not be instantiated
 * Final variables only be initialized once
 * Final method can not be overridden
 * 
 * Encapsulation : is an OOP concept where bundle the data(object's state) along with behavior
 * into a wrapper(class)
 * Data Hiding : mechanism to restrict access to some of the object components(using access
